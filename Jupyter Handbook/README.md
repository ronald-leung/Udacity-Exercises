# Jupyter Handbook
This folder contains a bunch of handy examples and snippets. The purpose of this project is to help keep these useful tricks fresh in the mind. We'll use some real data to make this interesting. Earlier this year the US National Women's Soccer team won the world cup in amazing fashion, and I will use data retrieved from ussoccer.com. The data isn't in a downloadable format, there may be better way to get these but I think this examples show retrieving clean data itself is an issue too. The data set used here is simply retrieved from copying the table from the website, pasting in excel and saved.

## Data Creation
- Numpy and Pandas

## Data Cleaning
Use of the following:
- .isnull()
- .isnull().any
- .isnull().sum() // How many rows have null values in each column
- .isnull().sum(axis=1) // How many rows have at least one null value
- forward and backfill
- Data filtering

## Data Transforming
- To Do
- Index manipulation
- Get Dummies
