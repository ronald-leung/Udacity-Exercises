This project include utilities for common statistical distributions such as binomial and gaussian distributions.
It includes easy to use functions for calculating mean, standard deviations, and more
  
## DataScienceNanoDegree:
This folder include many useful data wrangling exercises and jupyter notebooks from Udacity's awesome nano degree.
The exercises are grouped into various projects:
  
#### Project 1 - Write a Data Science blog
This project is a great exercise to practice the CRISM-DM process. It includes various real data provided by AirBnB in Seattle.
The data is provided as 3 separate files, including :
- calendar.csv: The price and availability date of each listing
- listings.csv: Featuers and detailed info about each listing
- reviews.csv: Customer reviews and scores for the listings
 
We will create a Jupyter notebook to apply the CRISM-DM process to investigate the data, perform required cleaning / refactoring of the data, 
and then we will use the data to answer some business questions.
